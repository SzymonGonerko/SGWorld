This is my last and greatest React project. In my previous app Vanilla-Date, I used 2D space. Now, I decided to go a step forward and use the maximum potential of 3D space. The main idea behind the project was to present my living space and the latest Vanilla-Date project. In the project, I used 3 React sub-libraries. React Cannon supports object physics. React Drei and React Fiber support HTML appearance and markup. I am the author of myself and the Paint.js object.
